Upload to GitHub artifacts,5712,"According to https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts#uploading-build-and-test-artifacts one can store artifacts also on GitHub workflows. This PR tries that. If it succeeds, I can shut down builds.jabref.org.

We already have that in - but IMHO at the wrong place.

"Revert ""Fix #5615 side pane not remembering position (#5629)""",5706,"This reverts commit 9ab537ffee59622b45631dab18286b3068edfc9a.

I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Unfortunately, in #5629 (which fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5615), a UI bug was introduced (at least for MacOs). The two screenshots show the problem:

Use GitVersion to increment build numbers,5682,"<!--

-->

Fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5399 and fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5657.
The following version information is automatically determined by GitVersion based on the current tags.

|  Context      | Build version |  Build information |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| PR            | 5.0.X         | 5.0-branch.Y       |
| Master        | 5.0.X         |  5.0               |
| After tag 5.1 | 5.1.X         |  5.1               |

Here, `X` is the number of commits since the last tag; and `Y is the number of commits on this branch; and `branch` is the branch name. Build version is the version used in gradle, i.e. the one used to generate the installer. Build information is what is displayed in the about dialog.
(Not sure if it really works on the master as it should; couldn't test it so far).

It should also work with tags of the form `5.0-beta` (which have `build version = 5.0.X` and `build information = 5.0-beta`). Thus, this PR hopefully also solves the problems of  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5684.
